This is an individual project in which a buffer manager was implemented by myself. The codes reside in the folder project2/BufferManager/src/bufmgr/, where I implemented Hash entry, page pinning, page unpinning, frame descriptor, and in bufmgr.java, I implemented LRU scheduling method for page replacement.

I passed the test cases 1,2,3.
